# Roulette Game

Welcome to the Roulette Game project! This project is a simple implementation of a roulette game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game simulates a spinning roulette wheel with a ball that bounces around, following the laws of physics.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- **index.html**: The main HTML document that sets up the structure of the roulette game. It includes references to the CSS and JavaScript files and contains the canvas element for rendering the game.
  
- **css/style.css**: Contains the styles for the roulette game, including layout, colors, and animations for the canvas and other UI elements.
  
- **js/main.js**: The entry point for the JavaScript code. It initializes the game, sets up the canvas, and handles user interactions such as starting the spin.
  
- **js/physics.js**: Contains functions and constants that simulate the physics of the spinning wheel and the ball, including gravity, friction, and collision detection.
  
- **js/wheel.js**: Defines the `Wheel` class, which represents the roulette wheel. It includes methods for drawing the wheel on the canvas, spinning the wheel, and determining the winning number.
  
- **assets/sounds/ball-rolling.mp3**: An audio asset that plays when the ball is rolling on the wheel.
  
- **assets/sounds/wheel-spinning.mp3**: An audio asset that plays when the wheel is spinning.

## How to Run the Game

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Click the "Spin" button to start the game and watch the wheel spin!
